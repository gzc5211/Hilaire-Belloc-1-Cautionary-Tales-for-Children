            <h3 id="T1">George,</h3>
            When George’s Grandmamma was told
            
            Three people stand together.
            
            
            That George had been as good as Gold,
            She Promised in the Afternoon
            To buy him an Immense BALLOON.
            
            One man selling balloon to another.
            
            And
            
            so she did; but when it came,
            It got into the candle flame,
            And being of a dangerous sort
            Exploded
            
            Something exploded infront two peoples.
            
            
            with a loud report!
            The Lights went out! The Windows broke!
            The Room was filled with reeking smoke.
            And in the darkness shrieks and yells
            Were mingled with Electric Bells,
            And falling masonry and groans,
            And crunching, as of broken bones,
            And dreadful shrieks, when, worst of all,
            The House itself began to fall!
            It tottered, shuddering to and fro,
            Then crashed into the street below—
            Which happened to be Savile Row.
            
            When Help arrived, among the Dead
            Were
            
            Cousin Mary,
            
            Old lady and a dog.
            
            
            Little Fred,
            
            A little boy.
            
            
            The Footmen
            
            Side view of two footmen
            
            
            (both of them),
            
            View of two footmen
            
            
            The Groom,
            
            One man with a head.
            
            
            The man that cleaned the Billiard-Room,
            
            Cleaning man.
            
            
            The Chaplain, and
            
            A man with black coat.
            
            
            The Still-Room Maid.
            
            An cleaning lady.
            
            And I am dreadfully afraid
            That Monsieur Champignon, the Chef,
            
            One waiter and a chef.
            
            Will now be
            
            permanently deaf—
            And both his
            
            Three peoples stand.
            
            Aides
            
            are much the same;
            While George, who was in part to blame,
            Received, you will regret to hear,
            A nasty lump
            
            One man carry.
            
            
            behind the ear.
            
            MORAL
            The moral is that little Boys
            Should not be given dangerous Toys.

            <h3 id="T1">Lord Lundy</h3>
            It happened to Lord Lundy then,
            As happens to so many men:
            Towards the age of twenty-six,
            They shoved him into politics;
            In which profession he commanded
            The income that his rank demanded
            In turn as Secretary for
            
            India, the Colonies, and War.
            But very soon his friends began
            To doubt if he were quite the man:
            Thus, if a member rose to say
            
            A man put his hand up
            
            (As members do from day to day),
            
            “Arising out of that reply ...!”
            
            
            Lord Lundy would begin to cry.
            
            A man just stand up and holding a papaer try to read.
            
            A Hint at harmless little jobs
            Would shake him with convulsive sobs.
            
            While as for Revelations, these
            Would simply bring him to his knees,
            And leave him whimpering like a child.
            It drove his Colleagues raving wild!
            They let him sink from Post to Post,
            From fifteen hundred at the most
            To eight, and barely six—and then
            To be Curator of Big Ben!...
            And finally there came a Threat
            To oust him from the Cabinet!
            
            
            The Duke—his aged grand-sire—bore
            The shame till he could bear no more.
            He rallied his declining powers,
            Summoned the youth to Brackley Towers,
            And bitterly addressed him thus—
            “Sir! you have disappointed us!
            We had intended you to be
            The next Prime Minister but three:
            The stocks were sold; the Press was squared:
            The Middle Class was quite prepared.
            But as it is!... My language fails!
            
            Go out and govern New South Wales!”
            
            one man pointing to another man
            
            
            The Aged Patriot groaned and died:
            And gracious! how Lord Lundy cried!
            
            one man are crying

            <h3 id="T1">Charles Augustus Fortescue,</h3>
            The nicest child I ever knew
            Was Charles Augustus Fortescue.
            He never lost his cap, or tore
            His stockings or his pinafore:
            In eating Bread he made no Crumbs,
            He was extremely fond of sums,
            
            A child talks to his father while his father is reading a newspaper.
            
            
            To which, however, he preferred
            The Parsing of a Latin Word—
            He sought, when it was in his power,
            For information twice an hour,
            And as for finding Mutton-Fat
            Unappetising, far from that!
            He often, at his Father’s Board,
            Would beg them, of his own accord,
            
            A family eating dinner at the table.
            
            
            To give him, if they did not mind,
            The Greasiest Morsels they could find—
            His Later Years did not belie
            The Promise of his Infancy.
            In Public Life he always tried
            To take a judgment Broad and Wide;
            
            A younger man telling an older man to sit on a stool.
            
            
            In Private, none was more than he
            Renowned for quiet courtesy.
            He rose at once in his Career,
            And long before his Fortieth Year
            Had wedded
            Fifi,
            
            
            A bride and groom at their wedding.
            
            Only Child
            Of Bunyan, First Lord Aberfylde.
            He thus became immensely Rich,
            And built the Splendid Mansion which
            Is called
            
            A mansion.
            
            
            the cedars muswell hill
            Where he resides in Affluence still
            To show what Everybody might
            Become by
            SIMPLY DOING RIGHT.

            <h3 id="T1">Lord Lundy</h3>
            Lord Lundy from his earliest years
             Was far too freely moved to Tears.
            For instance if his Mother said,
            “Lundy! It’s time to go to Bed!”
            He bellowed like a Little Turk.
            
            a woman holding a crying baby
            
            
            Or if his father Lord Dunquerque
             Said “Hi!” in a Commanding Tone,
            “Hi, Lundy! Leave the Cat alone!”
            Lord Lundy, letting go its tail,
            Would raise so terrible a wail
            
            a man yelling
            
            
            As move His Grandpapa the Duke 
            To utter the severe rebuke:
            “When I, Sir! was a little Boy,
            An Animal was not a Toy!”
            
            a tall man scolding a kid
            
            
            To utter the severe rebuke:
             “When I, Sir! was a little Boy,
            An Animal was not a Toy!”
             His father’s Elder Sister, who
            Was married to a Parvenoo,
            
            a man and a man standing next to each other
            
            
            Confided to Her Husband, “Drat!
            The Miserable, Peevish Brat!
            Why don’t they drown the Little Beast?”
            Suggestions which, to say the least,
            Are not what we expect to hear
            From Daughters of an English Peer.
            His grandmamma, His Mother’s Mother,
            Who had some dignity or other,
            The Garter, or no matter what,
            I can’t remember all the Lot!
            Said “Oh! that I were Brisk and Spry
            To give him that for which to cry!”
            (An empty wish, alas! for she Was Blind and nearly ninety-three).
            
            an old woman sitting on a throne
            
            
             The Dear Old Butler thought—but there!
             I really neither know nor care
             For what the Dear Old Butler thought!
             In my opinion, Butlers ought
             To know their place, and not to play
            The Old Retainer night and day
             I’m getting tired and so are you,
             Let’s cut the Poem into two!

            Young Algernon, the Doctor’s Son,
            Was playing with a Loaded Gun.
            
            a boy looking down the barrel of a gun
            
            
            He pointed it towards his sister,
            Aimed very carefully, but Missed her!
            
            a boy pointing a gun to the left of the book
            
            
            His Father, who was standing near,
            
            a &gt;man standing and plugging his ears
            
            
            The Loud Explosion chanced to Hear,
            
            a man and the boy standing together worried
            
            
            And reprimanded Algernon
            For playing with a Loaded Gun.

            <h3 id="T1">Jim</h3>    
            
            A picture of a lion lying on the ground
            
            There was a Boy whose name was Jim;
            His Friends were very good to him.
             They gave himTea, and Cakes, and Jam,
            And slices of deliciousHam,
            And Chocolate with pink inside,
            And little Tricycles to ride,
            And
            
            A picture of an older man reading to a child.
            
            
            read him Stories through and through,
            And even took him to the Zoo—
            But there it was the dreadful Fate
            Befell him, which I now relate.
            You know—at least you ought to know.
            For I have often told you so—
             That Children never are allowed
            To leave their Nurses in a Crowd;
            Now this was Jim’s especial Foible,
            He ran away when he was able,
            And on this inauspicious day
            He slipped his hand and ran away!
            He hadn’t gone a yard when—
            
            A picture of a lion push a man
            
            
            Bang!
            With open Jaws, a Lion sprang,
            And hungrily began to eat
            The Boy: beginning at his feet.
            Now just imagine how it feels
            When first your toes and then your heels,
            And then by gradual degrees,
            Your shins and ankles, calves and knees,
            Are slowly eaten, bit by bit.
            
            A picture of a lion push a man down
            
            
            No wonder Jim detested it!
            No wonder that he shouted “Hi!”
            The Honest Keeper heard his cry,
            Though very fat
            
            A picture of a fat man walking with a stick
            
            
            he almost ran
            To help the little gentleman.
            “Ponto!” he ordered as he came
            (For Ponto was the Lion’s name),
            “Ponto!” he cried,
            
            A picture of a man smoking
            
            
             with angry Frown.
            “Let go, Sir! Down, Sir! Put it down!”
             The Lion made a sudden Stop,
             He let the Dainty Morsel drop,
             And slunk reluctant to his Cage,
            Snarling with Disappointed Rage
            But when he bent him over Jim,
             The Honest Keeper’s
            
            A picture of a man poking with a man's head
            
            
             Eyes were dim.
            The Lion having reached his Head,
            The Miserable Boy was dead!
            
            A picture of an old woman talking with a couple
            
            
             When Nurse informed his Parents, they
            Were more Concerned than I can say:—
            His Mother, as She dried her eyes,
             Said, “Well—it gives me no surprise,
            He would not do as he was told!”
            His Father, who was self-controlled,
             Bade all the children round attend
             To James’ miserable end,
            And always keep a-hold of Nurse
            For fear of finding something worse.

            a general on a horse

            <h3 id="T1">Godolphin Horne,</h3>
            
            A man stands next to his shadow.
            
            Godolphin Horne was Nobly Born;
            He held the Human Race in Scorn,
            And lived with all his Sisters where
            His father lived, in Berkeley Square.
            And oh! the Lad was Deathly Proud!
            He never shook your Hand or Bowed,
            But merely smirked and nodded
            
            
            A poor man shows respect to a wealthier man.
            
            thus:
            How perfectly ridiculous!
            Alas! That such Affected Tricks
            Should flourish in a Child of Six!
            (For such was Young Godolphin’s age).
            
            Just then, the Court required a Page,
            Whereat
            
            
            Distinguished man stands with scepter.
            
            the Lord High Chamberlain
            (The Kindest and the Best of Men),
            He went good-naturedly and
            
            
            A man walks with a book.
            
            took
            A Perfectly Enormous Book
            Called People Qualified to Be
            Attendant on His Majesty,
            And murmured, as he scanned the list
            (To see that no one should be missed),
            “There’s
            
            A man sleeping in bed.
            
            
            William Coutts has got the Flue,
            
            
            A man stands widely.
            
            And Billy Higgs would never do,
            And Guy de Vere is far too young,
            
            A girl with a toy horse.
            
            
            And ... wasn’t D’Alton's Father hung?
            And as for Alexander Byng!— ...
            I think I know the kind of thing,
            A Churchman, cleanly, nobly born,
            
            A man being hung.
            
            Come
            
            let us say Godolphin Horne?”
            But hardly had he said the word
            When Murmurs of Dissent were heard.
            The King of Iceland’s Eldest Son
            Said, “Thank you! I am taking none!”
            The Aged Duchess of Athlone
            Remarked, in her sub-acid tone,
            “I doubt if He is what we need!”
            With which the Bishops all agreed;
            And even Lady Mary Flood
            (So Kind, and oh! so really good)
            Said, “No! He wouldn’t do at all,
            He’d make us feel a lot too small,”
            The Chamberlain said,
            “ ... Well, well, well!
            No doubt you’re right.... One cannot tell!”
            He took his Gold and Diamond Pen
            And
            
            A man signing papers.
            
            
            Scratched Godolphin out again.
            So now Godolphin is the Boy
            Who blacks the Boots at the Savoy.

            “There is no Cure for this Disease.
            Henry will very soon be dead.”
            His Parents stood about his Bed
            Lamenting his Untimely Death,
            When Henry, with his Latest Breath,
            Cried—
            “Oh, my Friends, be warned by me,
            
            A man is sitting on the bed.

             A Trick that everyone abhors
            In Little Girls is slamming Doors.

            Who lived in Palace Green, Bayswater
            (By name Rebecca Offendort),
            Was given to this Furious Sport.
            
            She would deliberately go
            
            And Slam the door like
            
            A little girl try to close the door

            She was not really bad at heart,
            But only rather rude and wild:
            She was an aggravating child....
            
            It happened that a Marble Bust
            Of Abraham was standing just
            Above the Door this little Lamb
            Had carefully prepared to Slam,
            And Down it came! It knocked her flat!
            
            A girl hanging

            Her funeral Sermon (which was long
            And followed by a Sacred Song)
            Mentioned her Virtues, it is true,
            But dwelt upon her Vices too,
            And showed the Dreadful End of One
            Who goes and slams the door for Fun.
            
            The children who were brought to hear
            The awful Tale from far and near
            Were much impressed,
            
            and inly swore
            They never more would slam the Door.

            For people such as me and you

            Because if things were really so,
