    <l>INTRODUCTION</l>
    <l>Upon being asked by a Reader whether the verses contained in this book were true.</l>
    <l> And is it True? It is not True.</l>
    <l>And if it were it wouldnâ€™t do,</l>
    <l>For people such as me and you</l>
    <l> Who pretty nearly all day long</l>
    <l>Are doing something rather wrong.</l>
    <l>Because if things were really so,</l>
    <l>You would have perished long ago,</l>
    <l>And I would not have lived to write</l>
    <l>The noble lines that meet your sight,</l>
    <l>Nor B. T. B. survived to draw</l>
    <l>The nicest things you ever saw.</l>
    <l> H. B.</l>
