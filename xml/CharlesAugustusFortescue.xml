<root><title>Charles Augustus Fortescue,</title>
<descrip>Who always Did what was Right, and so accumulated an Immense Fortune.
</descrip>


<p>The nicest child I ever knew
Was Charles Augustus Fortescue.
He never lost his cap, or tore
His stockings or his pinafore:
In eating Bread he made no Crumbs,
He was extremely fond of sums,</p>


<p>To which, however, he preferred
The Parsing of a Latin Word—
He sought, when it was in his power,
For information twice an hour,
And as for finding Mutton-Fat
Unappetising, far from that!
He often, at his Father’s Board,
Would beg them, of his own accord,</p>


<p>To give him, if they did not mind,
The Greasiest Morsels they could find—
His Later Years did not belie
The Promise of his Infancy.
In Public Life he always tried
To take a judgment Broad and Wide</p>;


<p>In Private, none was more than he
Renowned for quiet courtesy.
He rose at once in his Career,
And long before his Fortieth Year
Had wedded
</p>

<line>Fifi,</line>


<p>Only Child
Of Bunyan, First Lord Aberfylde.
He thus became immensely Rich,
And built the Splendid Mansion which
Is called</p>



<p>the cedars muswell hill
Where he resides in Affluence still
To show what Everybody might
Become by</p>

<line>SIMPLY DOING RIGHT.</line>
