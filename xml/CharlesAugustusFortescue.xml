<root><title>Charles Augustus Fortescue,</title>
<descrip>Who always Did what was Right, and so accumulated an Immense Fortune.
</descrip>


<lg><l>The <adject>nicest</adject> child I ever knew</l>
<l>Was <person>Charles Augustus Fortescue.</person></l>
<l>He never lost his <clothing>cap,</clothing> or tore</l>
<l>His <clothing>stockings</clothing> or his pinafore:</l>
<l>In <action>eating</action> <food>Bread</food> he made no <food>Crumbs,</food></l>
<l>He was extremely fond of sums,</l>

<lg><l>To which, however, he preferred</l>
<l>The Parsing of a Latin Word—</l>
<l>He sought, when it was in his power,</l>
<l>For information twice an hour,</l>
<l>And as for <action>finding</action> <food>Mutton-Fat</food></l>
<l>Unappetising, far from that!</l>
<l>He often, at his Father’s Board,</l>
<l>Would <action>beg</action> them, of his own accord,</l>

<lg><l>To give him, if they did not mind,</l>
<l>The Greasiest Morsels they could find—</l>
<l>His Later Years did not belie</l>
<l>The Promise of his Infancy.</l>
<l>In Public Life he always <action>tried</action></l>
<l>To take a judgment Broad and Wide;</l>

<lg><l>In Private, none was more than he</l>
<l>Renowned for quiet courtesy.</l>
<l>He <action>rose</action> at once in his Career,</l>
<l>And long before his Fortieth Year</l>
<l>Had <action>wedded</action></l>
<l>Fifi,</l>
