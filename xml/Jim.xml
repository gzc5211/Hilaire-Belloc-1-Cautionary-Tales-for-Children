      <l num="2"> Who ran away from his Nurse, and was eaten by a Lion.</l>

      <l num="3">There was a Boy whose name was Jim;</l>
      <l num="4">His Friends were very good to him.</l>
      <l num="5"> They gave him Tea, and Cakes, and Jam,</l>
      <l num="6">And slices of delicious Ham,</l>
      <l num="7">And Chocolate with pink inside,</l>
      <l num="8">And little Tricycles to ride,</l>
      <l num="9">And</l>

      <l num="10">read him Stories through and through,</l>
      <l num="11">And even took him to the Zoo—</l>
      <l num="12">But there it was the dreadful Fate</l>
      <l num="13">Befell him, which I now relate.</l>
      <l num="14">You know—at least you ought to know.</l>
      <l num="15">For I have often told you so—</l>
      <l num="16"> That Children never are allowed</l>
      <l num="17">To leave their Nurses in a Crowd;</l>
      <l num="18">Now this was Jim’s especial Foible,</l>
      <l num="19">He ran away when he was able,</l>
      <l num="20">And on this inauspicious day</l>
      <l num="21">He slipped his hand and ran away!</l>
      <l num="22">He hadn’t gone a yard when—</l>

      <l num="24">With open Jaws, a Lion sprang,</l>
      <l num="25">And hungrily began to eat</l>
      <l num="26">The Boy: beginning at his feet.</l>
      <l num="27">Now just imagine how it feels</l>
      <l num="28">When first your toes and then your heels,</l>
      <l num="29">And then by gradual degrees,</l>
      <l num="30">Your shins and ankles, calves and knees,</l>
      <l num="31">Are slowly eaten, bit by bit.</l>

      <l num="43"> The Lion made a sudden Stop,</l>
      <l num="44"> He let the Dainty Morsel drop,</l>
      <l num="45"> And slunk reluctant to his Cage,</l>
      <l num="46">Snarling with Disappointed Rage</l>
