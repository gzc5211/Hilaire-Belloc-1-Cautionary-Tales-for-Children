       <l> Jim,</l>
       <l> Who ran away from his Nurse, and was eaten by a Lion.</l>

        <l>There was a Boy whose name was Jim;</l>
        <l>His Friends were very good to him.</l>
       <l> They gave him Tea, and Cakes, and Jam,</l>
        <l>And slices of delicious Ham,</l>
        <l>And Chocolate with pink inside,</l>
        <l>And little Tricycles to ride,</l>
        <l>And</l>
    <picture url="../docs/illus/fhyde-2.jpg">
        <interp resp="gvc">A picture of a gerbil riding the bus</interp>
    </picture>
    <l>read him Stories through and through,</l>
    <l>And even took him to the Zoo—</l>
    <l>But there it was the dreadful Fate</l>
    <l>Befell him, which I now relate.</l>
    
    <l>You know—at least you ought to know.</l>
    <l>For I have often told you so—</l>
   <l> That Children never are allowed</l>
    <l>To leave their Nurses in a Crowd;</l>
    
    
    <l>Now this was Jim’s especial Foible,</l>
    <l>He ran away when he was able,</l>
    <l>And on this inauspicious day</l>
    <l>He slipped his hand and ran away!</l>
    <l>He hadn’t gone a yard when—</l>
    <picture url="../docs/illus/fhyde-2.jpg">
        <interp resp="gvc">A picture of a gerbil riding the bus</interp>
    </picture>
    <l>Bang!</l>
    <l>With open Jaws, a Lion sprang,</l>
    <l>And hungrily began to eat</l>
    <l>The Boy: beginning at his feet.</l>
    <l>Now just imagine how it feels</l>
    <l>When first your toes and then your heels,</l>
    <l>And then by gradual degrees,</l>
    <l>Your shins and ankles, calves and knees,</l>
    <l>Are slowly eaten, bit by bit.</l>

    <l>No wonder Jim detested it!</l>
    <l>No wonder that he shouted “Hi!”</l>
    <l>The Honest Keeper heard his cry,</l>
    <l>Though very fat</l>

    <l>he almost ran</l>
    <l>To help the little gentleman.</l>
    <l>“Ponto!” he ordered as he came</l>
    <l>(For Ponto was the Lion’s name),</l>
    <l>“Ponto!” he cried,</l>
    <picture url="../docs/illus/fhyde-2.jpg">
        <interp resp="gvc">A picture of a gerbil riding the bus</interp>
    </picture>
   <l> with angry Frown.</l>
    <l>“Let go, Sir! Down, Sir! Put it down!”</l>
    <l> The Lion made a sudden Stop,</l>
   <l> He let the Dainty Morsel drop,</l>
   <l> And slunk reluctant to his Cage,</l>
    <l>Snarling with Disappointed Rage</l>
    <l>But when he bent him over Jim,</l>
   <l> The Honest Keeper’s</l>
    <picture url="../docs/illus/fhyde-2.jpg">
        <interp resp="gvc">A picture of a gerbil riding the bus</interp>
    </picture>
   <l> Eyes were dim.</l>
    <l>The Lion having reached his Head,</l>
    <l>The Miserable Boy was dead!</l>

   <l> When Nurse informed his Parents, they</l>
    <l>Were more Concerned than I can say:—</l>
    <l>His Mother, as She dried her eyes,</l>
   <l> Said, “Well—it gives me no surprise,</l>
    <l>He would not do as he was told!”</l>
    <l>His Father, who was self-controlled,</l>
   <l> Bade all the children round attend</l>
   <l> To James’ miserable end,</l>
    <l>And always keep a-hold of Nurse</l>
    <l>For fear of finding something worse.</l>
