<l>Godolphin Horne was Nobly Born;</l>
<l>He held the Human Race in Scorn,</l>
<l>And lived with all his Sisters where</l>
<l>His father lived, in Berkeley Square.</l>
<l>And oh! the Lad was Deathly Proud!</l>
<l>He never shook your Hand or Bowed,</l>
<l>But merely smirked and nodded</l></lg>


<lg><l>thus:</l>
<l>How perfectly ridiculous!</l>
<l>Alas! That such Affected Tricks</l>
<l>Should flourish in a Child of Six!</l>
<l>(For such was Young Godolphin’s age).</l>
</lg>
<lg><l>Just then, the Court required a Page,</l>
<l>Whereat</l></lg>


<lg><l>the Lord High Chamberlain</l>
<l>(The Kindest and the Best of Men),</l>
<l>He went good-naturedly and</l></lg>



<lg><l>took</l>
<l>A Perfectly Enormous Book</l>
<l>Called People Qualified to Be</l>
<l>Attendant on His Majesty,</l>
<l>And murmured, as he scanned the list</l>
<l>(To see that no one should be missed),</l>
<l>“There’s</l></lg>



<lg><l>William Coutts has got the Flue,
</l>

<l>And Billy Higgs would never do,</l>

<l>And Guy de Vere is far too young,</l></lg>


<lg><l>And ... wasn’t D’Alton’s Father hung?</l>
<l>And as for Alexander Byng!— ...</l>
<l>I think I know the kind of thing,</l>
<l>A Churchman, cleanly, nobly born,</l>
<l>Come</l></lg>

<lg><l>let us say Godolphin Horne?”</l>
<l>But hardly had he said the word</l>
<l>When Murmurs of Dissent were heard.</l>
<l>The King of Iceland’s Eldest Son</l>
<l>Said, “Thank you! I am taking none!”</l>
<l>The Aged Duchess of Athlone</l>
<l>Remarked, in her sub-acid tone,</l>
<l>“I doubt if He is what we need!”</l>
<l>With which the Bishops all agreed;</l>
<l>And even Lady Mary Flood</l>
<l>(So Kind, and oh! so really good)</l>
<l>Said, “No! He wouldn’t do at all,</l>
<l>He’d make us feel a lot too small,”</l>
<l>The Chamberlain said</l>,</lg>

<lg><l>“ ... Well, well, well!</l>
<l>No doubt you’re right.... One cannot tell!”</l>
<l>He took his Gold and Diamond Pen</l>
<l>And</l></lg>


<lg><l>Scratched Godolphin out again.</l>
<l>So now Godolphin is the Boy</l>
<l>Who blacks the Boots at the Savoy.</l>
