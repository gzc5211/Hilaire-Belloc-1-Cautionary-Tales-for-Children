<l>Godolphin Horne was Nobly Born;</l>
<l>He held the Human Race in Scorn,</l>
<l>And lived with all his Sisters where</l>
<l>His father lived, in Berkeley Square.</l>

<l>Said, “Thank you! I am taking none!”</l>
<l>The Aged Duchess of Athlone</l>
<l>Remarked, in her sub-acid tone,</l>

<lg><l>“ ... Well, well, well!</l>
<l>No doubt you’re right.... One cannot tell!”</l>
<l>He took his Gold and Diamond Pen</l>
