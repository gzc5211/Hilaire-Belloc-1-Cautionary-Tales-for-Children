    <descrip>Lord Lundy
    (SECOND CANTO)</descrip>
    <lg>
        <l>It happened to Lord Lundy then,</l>
        <l>As happens to so many men:</l>
        <l>Towards the age of twenty-six,</l>
        <l>They shoved him into politics;</l>
        <l>In which profession he commanded</l>
        <l>The income that his rank demanded</l>
        <l>In turn as Secretary for</l>
        <l>India, the Colonies, and War.</l>
        <l>But very soon his friends began</l>
        <l>To doubt if he were quite the man:</l>
        <l>Thus, if a member rose to say</l>
        <l>(As members do from day to day),</l>

        <l>Lord Lundy would begin to cry.</l>
        <l>A Hint at harmless little jobs</l>
        <l>Would shake him with convulsive sobs.</l>
    </lg>
    
    <lg>
        <l>While as for Revelations, these</l>
        <l>Would simply bring him to his knees,</l>
        <l>And leave him whimpering like a child.</l>
        <l>It drove his Colleagues raving wild!</l>
        <l>They let him sink from Post to Post,</l>
        <l>From fifteen hundred at the most</l>
        <l>To eight, and barely six—and then</l>
        <l>To be Curator of Big Ben!...</l>
        <l>And finally there came a Threat</l>
        <l>To oust him from the Cabinet!</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
        <l>The Duke—his aged grand-sire—bore</l>
        <l>The shame till he could bear no more.</l>
        <l>He rallied his declining powers,</l>
        <l>Summoned the youth to Brackley Towers,</l>
        <l>And bitterly addressed him thus—</l>
        <l>“Sir! you have disappointed us!</l>
        <l>We had intended you to be</l>
        <l>The next Prime Minister but three:</l>
        <l>The stocks were sold; the Press was squared:</l>
        <l>The Middle Class was quite prepared.</l>
        <l>But as it is!... My language fails!</l>

    <lg><l>The Aged Patriot groaned and died:</l>
    <l>And gracious! how Lord Lundy cried!</l></lg>
