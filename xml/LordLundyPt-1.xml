    <descrip>Lord Lundy,
        Who was too Freely Moved to Tears, and thereby ruined his Political Career. </descrip>
    <lg>
        <l>Lord Lundy from his earliest years</l>
           <l> Was far too freely moved to Tears.</l>
            <l>For instance if his Mother said,</l>
            <l>“Lundy! It’s time to go to Bed!”</l>
            <l>He bellowed like a Little Turk.</l>

        <l>Or if his father Lord Dunquerque</l>
           <l> Said “Hi!” in a Commanding Tone,</l>
            <l>“Hi, Lundy! Leave the Cat alone!”</l>
            <l>Lord Lundy, letting go its tail,</l>
            <l>Would raise so terrible a wail</l>

        <l>As move His Grandpapa the Duke </l>
        <l>To utter the severe rebuke:</l>
            <l>“When I, Sir! was a little Boy,</l>
            <l>An Animal was not a Toy!”</l>

            <l>An Animal was not a Toy!”</l>
            <l> His father’s Elder Sister, who</l>
            <l>Was married to a Parvenoo,</l>

            <l>Why don’t they drown the Little Beast?”</l>
           <l>Suggestions which, to say the least,</l>
            <l>Are not what we expect to hear</l>
            <l>From Daughters of an English Peer.</l>
            <l>His grandmamma, His Mother’s Mother,</l>
            <l>Who had some dignity or other,</l>
            <l>The Garter, or no matter what,</l>
            <l>I can’t remember all the Lot!</l>
            <l>Said “Oh! that I were Brisk and Spry</l>
            <l>To give him that for which to cry!”</l>
        <l>(An empty wish, alas! for she Was Blind and nearly ninety-three).</l>
